# Space Shuttle Boilerplate

This is my custom html5 boilerplate that was created for my creative web development tools class. 

## Why Space Shuttle? 

To come up with a creative title for my boilerplate, I focused on the trait of re-usability. Since my interest is in space, I ended up thinking up the Space Shuttle. Although it still required a lot of replacements before it went back up, it had a few core reusable components. What could be a better comparison for a boilerplate?
